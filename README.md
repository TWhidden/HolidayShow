===========

C# / Mono project to run Raspberry Pi or Beagle bone blacks from a central machine controlling GPIOs.

This project has been used two years in a row now - 2013 and 2014.   Used in conjuction with Solid State Relays as well
as gas valves, we created a light and fire show using propane.   Needless to say, it was the most insane house in the hood.
